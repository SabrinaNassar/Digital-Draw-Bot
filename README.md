Playing with the idea of a drawing robot I found the concept of digitizing and making the drawing experience generative interesting.
Controling both your driving and drawing experience with a joystick that feeds these outputs data of points of destination.
Using mechanum wheels the robot is able to move any direction while facing forward creating a smooth drawing experience. 

The repository has all the code in differnet stages of getting this bot to work. 
File drawing_p5_to_processing_XBOXfade is the final code that was used to sucessfuly get this bot to work.
This code in combination with the serialWrite and joystick code make this code complete.

Things needed:
4 motors
1 XBOX controler
4 Mechanum wheels
arduino uno
motor sheild
long usb a to usb  cable
a computer compatable with an XBOX controler (I found that this code did not work on my mac.)
